3) **A company plans to run a monitoring application on an Amazon EC2 instance in a VPC. Connections
are made to the EC2 instance using the instance’s private IPv4 address. A solutions architect needs to
design a solution that will allow traffic to be quickly directed to a standby EC2 instance if the application
fails and becomes unreachable**

Which approach will meet these requirements?
A) Deploy an Application Load Balancer configured with a listener for the private IP address and register the
primary EC2 instance with the load balancer. Upon failure, de-register the instance and register the
standby EC2 instance.
B) Configure a custom DHCP option set. Configure DHCP to assign the same private IP address to the
standby EC2 instance when the primary EC2 instance fails.
C) Attach a secondary elastic network interface to the EC2 instance configured with the private IP address.
Move the network interface to the standby EC2 instance if the primary EC2 instance becomes
unreachable.
D) Associate an Elastic IP address with the network interface of the primary EC2 instance. Disassociate the
Elastic IP from the primary instance upon failure and associate it with a standby EC2 instance.
To design a solution that allows traffic to be quickly directed to a standby EC2 instance in case of application failure, while using the instance's private IPv4 address, the following approach can be considered:

C) **Attach a secondary elastic network interface to the EC2 instance configured with the private IP address. Move the network interface to the standby EC2 instance if the primary EC2 instance becomes unreachable**: This approach involves using an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) which can be detached from one instance and attached to another. By configuring the ENI with the required private IP address, you can quickly switch traffic to a standby instance by simply moving the ENI to it in the event of a failure. This method is effective for failover scenarios within the same subnet and Availability Zone.

Let's review why the other options might not be as suitable:

A) **Deploy an Application Load Balancer configured with a listener for the private IP address and register the primary EC2 instance with the load balancer. Upon failure, de-register the instance and register the standby EC2 instance**: While Application Load Balancers are great for distributing incoming traffic among multiple instances, they don't directly address the requirement to use the instance's private IPv4 address for connections. Load balancers typically use their own DNS names for routing traffic.

B) **Configure a custom DHCP option set. Configure DHCP to assign the same private IP address to the standby EC2 instance when the primary EC2 instance fails**: DHCP option sets in AWS do not provide the capability to dynamically reassign a private IP from one instance to another based on instance health or failure conditions. DHCP settings are typically static and not used for failover purposes.

D) **Associate an Elastic IP address with the network interface of the primary EC2 instance. Disassociate the Elastic IP from the primary instance upon failure and associate it with a standby EC2 instance**: Elastic IPs are public IPv4 addresses that can be associated with instances. Since the requirement is to use the instance’s private IPv4 address for connections, this approach does not meet the specified criteria.

Therefore, the most suitable solution is **C) Attach a secondary elastic network interface to the EC2 instance configured with the private IP address, and move this network interface to the standby EC2 instance in case the primary becomes unreachable**. This allows for a quick redirection of traffic to a standby instance using the same private IP address.
